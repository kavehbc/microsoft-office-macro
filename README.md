## Microsoft Word Macro - VBA
### Eq_ChangeFont
This macro changes the font of all equations in a MS Word document.

### Mark_Long
This macro counts the words and marks the sentences with more than a specific number of words (e.g. 30). According to the ["English for Writing Research Papers"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-7922-3), the maximum of 30 words per sentence is acceptable for research articles. This macro helps authors to recognize the long sentences thus to simplify them.

### ENChangeCitationColor
This macro marks (DarkBlue) the in-line citations of [EndNote](http://www.endnote.com/).
EndNote software does not have any built-in feature to change the color of in-line citations in a Word document. This macro changes the color of all citations made by EndNote, and makes the references in a document clear.

> It requires "Microsoft XML v6.0" to be added/checked in references (VBA Editor: Tools > References).

## Microsoft Powerpoint Macro - VBA
### PP_Footer_Outline
This macro writes the names of the sections in the Powerpoint footer, and it changes the font/color of the current section in order to show which section the slide belongs to. In addition, it writes the active slide number and total number of slides dynamically (e.g. x of X) without hardcoding the total number.
